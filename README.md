# Code Interpreter

 Code interpreter provides a way for agents to execute python code in a sand boxed enviornment for data analysis, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF processing, and visualizations.
 
 ## Use it for:
- Processing files with diverse data and formatting
- Generating files with data and images of graphs
- Writing and running code iteratively to solve problemsâ€”for example, a model that writes code that fails to run can keep rewriting and running that code until it succeeds
- Boosting visual intelligence . The model can use this tool to crop, zoom, rotate, and otherwise process and transform images.

## How to Use :
- Add it as a tool to your AI agent


# Technical Notes

This Project aims to prototype the to execute Python code within a sandboxed docker container. 

This solution ensures code isolation , support file input/output via mapped directories and restrict execution to python code only.
